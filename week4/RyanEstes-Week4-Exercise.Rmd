```

*Directions*: 

* Write your R code inside the code chunks after each question.
* Write your answer comments after the `#` sign.
* To generate the word document output, click the button `Knit` and wait for the word document to appear.
* RStudio will prompt you (only once) to install the `knitr` package.
* Submit your completed laboratory exercise using Blackboard's Turnitin feature. Your Turnitin upload link is found on your Blackboard Course shell under the Laboratory folder.

For this exercise, you will need to use the package `mosaic` to find numerical and graphical summaries.

```{r}
library(mosaic) # load the package mosaic to use its functions
library(dplyr) # load the package dplyr to use its functions
library(gapminder)  # load the package gapminder for question 1
```


1. Using the gapminder data in the lesson, do the following:  
      i) use `filter` to select all countries with the following arguments:  
          a) life expectancy larger than 60 years.   
          b) United Kingdom and Vietnam and years greater than 1990.  
      ii) use `arrange` and `slice` to select the countries with the top 15 GDP per capital `gdpPercap`. Use the pipe `%>%` operator to string multiple functions.
      iii) use `mutate` to create a new variable called `gdpPercap_lifeExp` which is the quotient of `gdpPercap` and `lifeExp` and display the output.  
      iv) use `summarise` to find the average or mean value of the variable `gdpPercap_lifeExp` created in part (iii).     
      v) use `group_by` to group the countries by `continent`; and `summarise` to compute the average life expectancy `lifeExp` within each continent. Use the pipe `%>%` operator to string multiple functions.
      
      

### Code chunk
```{r} 
# load the necessary packages
library(mosaic)
library(dplyr)
library(gapminder)

# i)
# a)
filter(gapminder, lifeExp > 60)
# b)
filter(gapminder, country %in% c("United States", "Vietnam"), year > 1990)

# ii)
gapminder %>%
  arrange(desc(gdpPercap)) %>%
  slice(1:15)

# iii)
gapminder %>%
  mutate(gdpPercap_lifeExp = gdpPercap / lifeExp) %>%
  select(country, year, gdpPercap_lifeExp)

# iv)
gapminder %>%
  mutate(gdpPercap_lifeExp = gdpPercap / lifeExp) %>%
  summarise(avgGDP_Expect = mean(gdpPercap_lifeExp))

# v)
gapminder %>%
  group_by(continent) %>%
  summarise(mean(lifeExp))

2. The data set `MLB-TeamBatting-S16.csv` contains MLB Team Batting Data for selected variables. Load the data set from the given url using the code below. This data set was obtained from [Baseball Reference](https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/MLB/2016-standard-batting.shtml).
    * Tm - Team   
    * Lg - League: American League (AL), National League (NL)  
    * BatAge - Battersâ€™ average age  
    * RPG - Runs Scored Per Game  
    * G - Games Played or Pitched  
    * AB - At Bats  
    * R - Runs Scored/Allowed  
    * H - Hits/Hits Allowed  
    * HR - Home Runs Hit/Allowed  
    * RBI - Runs Batted In  
    * SO - Strikeouts  
    * BA - Hits/At Bats  
    * SH - Sacrifice Hits (Sacrifice Bunts)  
    * SF - Sacrifice Flies  

    Using the `mlb16.data` data, do the following:      
      i) use `filter` to select teams with the following arguments:        
                 a) Cardinals team `STL`.    
                  b) teams with Hits `H` more than 1400 last 2016 season.   
                  c) team league `Lg` is National League `NL`.   
      ii) use `arrange` to select teams in decreasing number of home runs `HR`.      
      iii) use `group_by` to group the teams per league `lg`; and `arrange` to display the teams in decreasing number of `RBI` within each league. Use the pipe `%>%` operator to string multiple functions.       
      iv) use `group_by` to group the teams per league; and `summarise` to compute the average `RBI` within each league. Use the pipe `%>%` operator to string multiple functions.   
      


### Code chunk
```{r} 
# load the data set
mlb16.data <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jpailden/rstatlab/master/data/MLB-TeamBatting-S16.csv")

head(mlb16.data)  # show first six rows

# i)
# a)
filter(mlb16.data, Tm == "STL")
# b)
filter(mlb16.data, H > 1400)
# c)
filter(mlb16.data, Lg == "NL")

# ii)
mlb16.data %>%
  arrange(desc(HR))

# iii)
mlb16.data %>%
  group_by(Lg) %>%
  arrange(desc(RBI))

# iv)
mlb16.data %>%
  group_by(Lg) %>%
  summarise(mean(RBI))
